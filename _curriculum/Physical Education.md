**Our Strategy**

  

Effective Physical Education teaching and learning is accomplished through an integration of various approaches which aim to help students develop a foundation for an active life. These approaches include:

Games-related concepts are introduced to students through modified games at the upper primary and reinforced at the secondary levels. Both fundamental and specialised skills and movement concepts are required in playing these games. In this syllabus, games are classified into the following categories:

  

*   net-barrier;
*   striking-fielding;
*   territorial-invasion.

  

Within each game category, there are games-related concepts that are transferrable across games within the same category. Game-specific skills are also identified for selected games for the learning area of Physical Activities

### **Key programmes**


**Our Key Programmes**

  

In the design of our programmes, we focus on the building of a strong foundation at lower primary and reinforcing concepts at upper primary. We also strive to create opportunities for students to build strong fundamental skills to ultimately play modified games through PE lessons.

  

**Delivery of PE lessons**

  

*   _Differentiated Instructions_

Equipment are modified based on the abilities of the students eg starting from their entry level – hands coordination to using equipment;

Tasks are modified to suit the ability of the students.

  

*   _Self-paced feedback and assessment_

Range of objectives told to students so that they can practise at their own comfort level. Through this approach, students tend to have a higher rate of success and take ownership of their learning

  

*   _Games Day / Interclass_

Objective of the Games Day/ Interclass is to create a fun and memorable experience for the students to remember their childhood by (think Singapore Spirit), and also to allow the students to put into practice what they have learnt during their PE lessons.

  

*   _Active Kids Programme_

Through this platform, students are engaged in diverse range of physical activities they would not experience in a normal PE class setting. This programme together with the HPB collaboration, aims to reduce the mass of the overweight and raise their self-esteem.

  

*   _Morning Exercise and Loan of Equipment Exercise (MELEX)_
*   _Recess Exercise and Loan of Equipment Exercise (RELEX)_

It is important for students to practise as much as they can to become more skilled. Through this platform, students can show their values education of responsibility in returning the equipment in the same condition as it has been taken.

  

*   _P5 Camp_

We believe that it is important for students to learn values and build character. An adventure camp provides the necessary platform and beyond; students can learn outdoor education, bond with each other and learn independence.

  

**Guidelines for Physical Education Teachers**

  

_Professional Competency_

“Every teacher needs to improve not because they are not good enough, but because they can be even better.” – Dylan Williams

  

*   _Workshops_

PE teachers will go for workshop to constantly update and upgrade themselves and keep themselves abreast of developments in this field.

  

In-house PE workshops will be conducted by the PE teachers during their TTT.

  

*   _Delivery of Lessons_

The teacher's role is to provide appropriate and extensive learning experiences by careful selection of resource materials to facilitate learning. Teachers need to adopt a variety of approaches to implement the curriculum in ways that best cater to the abilities, needs and interests of the students.

  

PE teachers will be briefed at the beginning of the year on expectations and delivery of PE lessons. All PE teachers are to adhere to SOW and the delivery of PE lessons.

  

*   _Assessment_

Teachers will use both formal and informal assessment. Informal assessment is used very frequently to provide necessary correction and refinement to movements. Formal assessment will be carried out using a set of rubrics to inform parents’ about their child’s progress through the Semester Holistic Report Checklist for P1 and P2
