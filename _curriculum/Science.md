#### **Curriculum and pedagogy / Approach**


![](/images/Curriculum/Science/ScienceCurriculumFramework.png)

The&nbsp;**Science Curriculum Framework**&nbsp;is derived from the&nbsp;_Policy Framework for the Teaching and Learning of Science_. It encapsulates the thrust of science education in Singapore to prepare our students to be sufficiently adept as effective citizens, able to function in and contribute to an increasingly technologically-driven world.

  

Central to the curriculum framework is the planned inculcation of the spirit of scientific inquiry. The conduct of inquiry is founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills and Processes and (c) Ethics and Attitudes. These domains are essential to the practice of science.

  

The curriculum design seeks to enable students to view the pursuit of science as meaningful and useful. Inquiry is thus grounded in knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by science in daily life, society and the environment.
