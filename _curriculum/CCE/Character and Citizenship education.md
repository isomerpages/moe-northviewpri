<h3><strong>1. CCE Committee Overview</strong></h3>
<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is at the heart of school life
in North View Primary School. Through CCE, we nurture every Northviewan
to grow in character, well-being and citizenship, so that they become confident
learners and caring leaders who contribute to their family, school and
nation. CCE is not just a subject. It is experienced through daily interactions,
Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP), CCE (MTL), Social Studies, Values-in-Action
(VIA), student leadership, co-curricular activities, learning journeys,
assemblies and school-wide programmes.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Our Approach: Head, Heart and Hand in Actio</strong></h3>
<p>We use the Head–Heart–Hand lens to guide the design of CCE:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Head</strong> – Building understanding, judgement and critical
thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heart</strong> – Shaping values, empathy and motivation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hand</strong> – Translating values into action and contribution</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To bring this to life, we organise our work around <strong>intentional teaching, meaningful experiences and guided reflection</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<h4><strong>4. Key Focus Areas of CCE @ NVPS</strong></h4>
<p><strong>a. Social-Emotional Learning and Well-Being</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn to understand and manage their emotions, build positive
relationships and make responsible decisions. We promote mental well-being,
help-seeking behaviour and a culture of care in classrooms and across the
school.</p>
<p><strong>b. Cyber Wellness and Digital Responsibility</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are taught to use technology safely and responsibly, manage their
digital footprints and respond wisely to online risks, while balancing
screen time with healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>c. Values-in-Action (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Our VIA progression provides age-appropriate opportunities for students
to care for their:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Self (P1–P2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School (P3–P4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community (P5–P6)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students do and reflect on their actions so that they understand why and
how their actions matter.</p>
<p><strong>d. National Education and Citizenship</strong>
</p>
<p>Through NE commemorative days, Social Studies and learning journeys, students
learn about Singapore’s history, challenges and strengths. They build a
sense of belonging, pride and responsibility towards our nation.</p>
<p><strong>e. Student Leadership and Peer Support</strong>
</p>
<p>We adopt a tiered leadership approach: Lead Self → Lead Peers → Lead School.
<br>Students serve as Class Leaders, Peer Support Leaders, CCA leaders, Prefects&nbsp;
and are guided to influence peers positively and support a caring school
culture.</p>
<h4><strong>5. The Northviewan CCE Journey (P1–P6)</strong></h4>
<p>Across six years, students experience a <strong>coherent, progressive CCE curriculum</strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lower Primary (P1–P2)</strong> – Building foundations in values,
friendship skills, routines, school belonging and basic self-management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle Primary (P3–P4)</strong> – Deepening respect, responsibility
and care for others, strengthening resilience, digital responsibility and
environmental stewardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upper Primary (P5–P6)</strong> – Developing leadership, moral reasoning,
national identity, appreciation of diversity and readiness for secondary
school and beyond.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At each stage, students have opportunities to <strong>care, think and act</strong> in
ways that are developmentally appropriate and meaningful.</p>
<h4><strong>6. Partnering Home and Community</strong></h4>
<p>CCE is most effective when <strong>school, home and community work together</strong>.
We partner parents and community organisations through:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Joint VIA projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyber wellness and well-being talks for parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support from the Parent Support Group (PSG)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration with community and social service agencies</p>
<p>Together, we support every Northviewan to grow in character and citizenship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
