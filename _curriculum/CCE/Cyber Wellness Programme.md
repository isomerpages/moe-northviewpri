A Cyber Wellness Week was organised from 18 to 24 May 2018 to promote mass awareness of cyber wellness through multiple learning activities in a carnival setting during recess. One of the theme was “Media multitasking”. The students discovered that they lost efficiency when doing work on the Internet if they were unable to concentrate on one thing at a time through a game which required them to juggle between two activities.

  

The pupils had a wonderful time learning about the different aspects of Cyber Wellness through fun quizzes and games. They also played the C-Quest app game using the i-pads
