The Peer Support Leaders (PSL) also play an active role in sharing with their peers about Cyber Wellness. For example, selected PSLs were involved in creating an awareness video and posters on Cyber Bullying. They also did a video presentation during their FTGP lesson. Click on the links below to watch some of the Cyber Wellness Videos that students were involved in.

The Mother Tongue Department and Student Well-Being Committee also collaborated to publish an electronic comic book, titled “Say NO to School Bullying”. On 26 July 2022, the school invited Dr Gary Goh, a famous comic artist in Singapore, to conduct a comic drawing workshop for the students. Students created a comic with the theme “Say NO to School Bullying”.
