<p>In North View Primary, our teachers celebrate collaboration and constantly
develop our skills to be competent in using technology for effective teaching
and learning. There is easy access to devices and resources to ensure seamless
learning. The use of ICT to enhance teaching and learning is integrated
meaningfully into the curriculum.</p>
<p>As an effort to promote self-directed and collaborative learning, e-learning
programmes are designed for students. Online portals such as the Singapore
Student Learning Space (SLS), Koobits and e-zhishi portal provide the different
platforms for an engaged and enriched learning where students would be
able to access to online resources or learning packages.</p>
