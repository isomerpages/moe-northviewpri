In North View Primary, our teachers celebrate collaboration and constantly develop our skills to be competent in using technology for effective teaching and learning. There is easy access to devices and resources to ensure seamless learning. The use of ICT to enhance teaching and learning is integrated meaningfully into the curriculum.

  

As an effort to promote self-directed and collaborative learning, e-learning programmes are designed for students. Online portals such as the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS), MOE i-MTL portal, e-zhishi portal and Scholastic reading portal as well as as online collaboration tools such as Zoom, provide the different platforms for an engaged and enriched learning where students would be able to access to online resources or learning packages.

  

We also follow closely to the MOE Cyber Wellness framework and educate North Viewans to be responsible Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace.
