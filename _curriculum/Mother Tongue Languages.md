<h4><strong>Department Overview</strong></h4>
<p>Our mission is to nurture our students to be a passionate learner who
is a confident communicator. We are committed to inspire our students to
learn and use their Mother Tongue language effectively.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum and pedagogy / Approach</strong></h4>
<p>MTL department uses varied teaching pedagogies and differentiated activities
to engage our students in learning of Mother Tongue Languages in an authentic
and conducive environment. Making thinking visible is one key area that
the department is working on, teachers provide various thinking routines
to encourage students to vocalize their ideas and develop their competencies.</p>
<p>In order to meet the learning needs of students from varied background,
the MTL curriculum adapts itself to offer greater flexibility in its teaching
and learning. Those who exhibit mastery can advance and those who need
reinforcement can move forward with the additional support so that they
can move forward when they are ready.</p>
<p>The department adopts a 3 “C” approach in designing of our programmes:
Communication, Culture and Connection. The introduction of MTL Experiential
Learning Experiences and various MTL Enrichment Programmes are to promote
the Joy of Learning in MTL and inject authentic experiences for our students.</p>

to ensure that the learning of MTL is interactive, connected and engaging.</p>
