<h4><strong>Department Overview</strong></h4>
<p>“Mathematics contributes to the development and understanding in many
disciplines and provides the foundation for many of today’s innovations
and tomorrow’s solutions. It also underpins many aspects of our everyday
activities, from making sense of information around us to making informed
decisions about personal finances”. (CPDD, MOE 2021)</p>
<p>In primary mathematics education, problem-solving proficiency is nurtured
through interconnected elements: concepts, skills, processes, metacognition,
and attitudes. Essential components include grasping mathematical concepts,
mastering operations and algorithms, and employing abstract reasoning.
Metacognition aids in selecting strategies, while positive attitudes drive
motivation and perseverance in problem-solving endeavors.</p>

<p>As such, the mathematics teachers seek to engage our students to do Mathematics
so that they will be able to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire and apply math concepts and skills well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage actively in mathematics problem solving that involve logical reasoning
and creative thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop metacognitive thinking that promote self-directed learning and
reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop the interest and confidence in learning math</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Curriculum and Pedagogy / Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Key pedagogical approaches</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Mathematical concepts are abstract. To develop an understanding of these
abstract concepts, teaching and learning starts from concrete objects,
examples and experiences that students can relate to. The concrete-pictorial-abstract
(CPA) approach is an important consideration in the sequencing of learning.
For example, in learning Fractions, concrete manipulatives such as fraction
discs and fraction bars are used in helping students make sense of fractions
and the concepts involving fractions.</p>
<p>In learning other concepts such as Geometry and Measurement, students
use concrete models and manipulatives such as Anglegs and square tiles
to explore and discover geometric shapes and properties and make connections
between concepts through hands-on activities.</p>
<p>For Statistics, students will learn to conduct simple survey where they
collect data and/ or use ICT tools to represent the data in the form of
a bar graph, line graph or pie-chart. Through these, they reason about
how data can be collected systematically, and which types of graphs convey
the data analytics most clearly.</p>
<p><strong><u>RCC (Reasoning, Communication, Connection)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In response to the evolving educational landscape, our department recognised
the limitations of traditional teacher-centric approaches in meeting the
diverse learning needs of today's students. In pursuit of fostering preparedness
for the challenges of the 21st century, RCC is used in daily classrooms.
This embodies a pedagogical shift towards inquiry-based learning, meticulously
curating comprehensive lesson packages for specific topics.</p>
<p>These packages are meticulously crafted to cultivate confident communicators
with strong reasoning abilities. Leveraging technology, our approach emphasises
student-centric activities enriched with authentic learning experiences.
By anchoring learning in relevance to students' lives, engagement and meaningfulness
are heightened. Our overarching goal is to empower students to actively
engage with mathematics through stimulating discussions and activities
that encourage exploration, reasoning, and communication. Through collaborative
endeavours with peers, the math department hopes to create a dynamic learning
environment where students are encouraged to discover possibilities and
forge connections.</p>

<p>Problem-solving is not just about finding answers; it's about developing
a systematic approach to tackle complex problems. One effective thinking
routine is to encourage students to follow a structured process. The problem
solving thinking tool in North View Primary School has been developed by
our school teachers, with reference to George Polya’s<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCS7GO0fkc4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">4 principles of problem solving (1945)</a> and
‘BEST’ checklist (NIE, Dr Joseph Yeo). The purpose of the tool is not about
the acronyms but the questions embedded that students need to ask themselves
when attempting a problem sum.</p>
<p>By practicing this problem-solving routine on a regular basis, students
not only enhance their mathematical skills but also cultivate critical
thinking, creativity, and resilience. Through regular application of this
routine, students become adept problem solvers, equipped to tackle challenges
across various domains of mathematics and beyond.</p>
