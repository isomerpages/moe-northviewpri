#### **Department Overview**


‘Mathematics contributes to the development and understanding in many disciplines and provides the foundation for many of today’s innovations and tomorrow’s solutions. It also underpins many aspects of our everyday activities, from making sense of information around us to making informed decisions about personal finances’. (CPDD, MOE 2021)

  

In our mathematics curriculum, we seek to lay the foundation for the learning of mathematics for all students, equipping them with a tool for everyday life and the knowledge and skills for and interest in learning mathematics at secondary level and beyond.

  

As such, the mathematics teachers seek to engage our students to do Math so that they will be able to:

*   acquire and apply math concepts and skills well
*   engage actively in mathematics problem solving that involve logical reasoning and creative thinking
*   develop metacognitive thinking that promote self-directed learning and reflection
*   develop the interest and confidence in learning math

#### **Curriculum and Pedagogy / Approach**


**Key pedagogical approaches**

  

Mathematical concepts are abstract. To develop an understanding of these abstract concepts, teaching and learning starts from concrete objects, examples and experiences that students can relate to. The concrete-pictorial-abstract approach is an important consideration in the sequencing of learning. For example, in learning Fractions, concrete manipulatives such as fraction discs and fraction bars are used in helping students make sense of fractions and the concepts involving fractions.

  

In learning other concepts such as Geometry and Measurement, students use concrete models and manipulatives such as Anglegs and square tiles to explore and discover geometric shapes and properties and make connections between concepts through hands-on activities.

  

For Statistics, students will learn to conduct simple survey where they collect data and/ or use ICT tools to represent the data in the form of a bar graph, line graph or pie-chart. Through these, they reason about how data can be collected systematically and which types of graphs convey the data analytics most clearly.

  

**SPARK Problem Solving Thinking Routine**

The tool has been developed by our school teachers, with reference to George Polya’s&nbsp;[4 principles of problem solving (1945)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCS7GO0fkc4)&nbsp;and ‘BEST’ checklist (NIE, Joseph Yeo).
