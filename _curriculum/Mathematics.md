#### **Department Overview**


“Mathematics contributes to the development and understanding in many disciplines and provides the foundation for many of today’s innovations and tomorrow’s solutions. It also underpins many aspects of our everyday activities, from making sense of information around us to making informed decisions about personal finances”. (CPDD, MOE 2021)

In primary mathematics education, problem-solving proficiency is nurtured through interconnected elements: concepts, skills, processes, metacognition, and attitudes. Essential components include grasping mathematical concepts, mastering operations and algorithms, and employing abstract reasoning. Metacognition aids in selecting strategies, while positive attitudes drive motivation and perseverance in problem-solving endeavors.

As such, the mathematics teachers seek to engage our students to do Mathematics so that they will be able to: 
* acquire and apply math concepts and skills well
* engage actively in mathematics problem solving that involve logical reasoning and creative thinking
* develop metacognitive thinking that promote self-directed learning and reflection
* develop the interest and confidence in learning math

#### **Curriculum and Pedagogy / Approach**


**Key pedagogical approaches**

Mathematical concepts are abstract. To develop an understanding of these abstract concepts, teaching and learning starts from concrete objects, examples and experiences that students can relate to. The concrete-pictorial-abstract (CPA) approach is an important consideration in the sequencing of learning. For example, in learning Fractions, concrete manipulatives such as fraction discs and fraction bars are used in helping students make sense of fractions and the concepts involving fractions.

In learning other concepts such as Geometry and Measurement, students use concrete models and manipulatives such as Anglegs and square tiles to explore and discover geometric shapes and properties and make connections between concepts through hands-on activities.

For Statistics, students will learn to conduct simple survey where they collect data and/ or use ICT tools to represent the data in the form of a bar graph, line graph or pie-chart. Through these, they reason about how data can be collected systematically, and which types of graphs convey the data analytics most clearly.

  

**RCC (Reasoning, Communication, Connection)**

In response to the evolving educational landscape, our department recognised the limitations of traditional teacher-centric approaches in meeting the diverse learning needs of today's students. In pursuit of fostering preparedness for the challenges of the 21st century, RCC is used in daily classrooms. This embodies a pedagogical shift towards inquiry-based learning, meticulously curating comprehensive lesson packages for specific topics. 

These packages are meticulously crafted to cultivate confident communicators with strong reasoning abilities. Leveraging technology, our approach emphasises student-centric activities enriched with authentic learning experiences. By anchoring learning in relevance to students' lives, engagement and meaningfulness are heightened. Our overarching goal is to empower students to actively engage with mathematics through stimulating discussions and activities that encourage exploration, reasoning, and communication. Through collaborative endeavours with peers, the math department hopes to create a dynamic learning environment where students are encouraged to discover possibilities and forge connections.
