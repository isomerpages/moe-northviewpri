**INTRODUCTION**

  

Big Heart Student Care @ North View aims to provide quality and affordable after-school care services for students, especially for those who can benefit from a structured and supportive environment in after-school care, and particularly where parents/caregivers are both working.

  

With its vision, Inspiring Minds • Touching Hearts, our school-based student care centre supports the holistic development of its students through its partnership with the Ministry of Education and strong support from the four Self Help Groups, parents, schools and the community. The holistic programme is designed in collaboration with schools and other organisations to cater to the development of a student’s socio-emotional, intellectual, physical, recreational and creative needs, and to reinforce learning for students who need additional support.
