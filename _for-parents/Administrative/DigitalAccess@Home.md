During the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) Committee of Supply (COS) parliamentary debate on 28 February 2023, Minister Josephine Teo announced that IMDA is introducing a new DigitalAccess@Home scheme to provide subsidised broadband and digital devices (laptop or tablet) to low-income Singaporean households to strengthen digital inclusion. The scheme will replace the existing Home Access and NEU PC Plus programmes.

Eligible households can apply for the scheme through a **simplified application process** and enjoy the **flexibility to choose their device and broadband connectivity according to their needs.**

Applicants (aged 21 and above) may refer to the DigitalAccess@Home website for the eligibility, subsidy criteria and application details. ([www.digitalaccess.gov.sg](http://www.digitalaccess.gov.sg)).
