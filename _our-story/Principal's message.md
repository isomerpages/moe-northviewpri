**Passionate Learners and Caring Leaders in**
**North View Primary & MK@North View**



  

2022 is going to be an exciting year for North View Primary School!

  

First, we warmly welcome the MOE Kindergarten, MK@North View, into the North View community. The MK provides unique opportunities for our primary students to demonstrate and apply “caring leadership”. There will be numerous occasions where older students can look out for the younger kindergarten students; to be gracious, attentive and exhibit care. They can be good role models and provide positive examples for the MK students. These older “brothers” and “sisters” can inspire these kindergarten students to join them in the primary school. The expansion of the North View community will add vibrancy for both students and staff. MK students can enjoy learning journeys to our Science garden while our primary students can do VIA (Values in Action) projects with the MK students. MK and primary school staff can exchange notes on teaching experiences, tap on each other’s expertise and share teaching resources. Such exchanges will enhance professional practice and aid the transition of MK students into primary education.

  

Secondly, we look forward to the completion of PERI (Primary Education Review and Implementation) project in our school by the middle of the year. With the completion of PERI, our primary students can look forward to better facilities. There will be new learning spaces, an indoor sports hall, a new playground, an outdoor adventure learning centre, a multi-disciplinary learning trail and a new eco-garden. We will also have a new and bigger MRL (media resource library) with ICT-enabled interactive stations that will provide engaging learning experiences. Our MK students will also see the completion of their new “school”, which is housed in the new PERI block. This new MK environment is equipped to meet the needs of early childhood education and will support the developmental needs of students as they learn and grow.

  

The completion of PERI provides new and exciting “hardware” that staff can use to design pedagogically meaningful and engaging learning experiences for all students. Students can definitely look forward to more hands-on and authentic learning experiences in 2022. But our school is also about “heartware”. In 2022, our school remains firmly committed to nurture in the Northviewans, strong anchors in character and to develop in students a passion to learn, not just for the sake of passing exams but because they truly look forward to learning. As Anthony J. D’Angelo once said, “Develop a passion for learning. If you do, you will never cease to grow.” We hope that in 2022, the North View community will continue to grow from strength to strength!

  

Wishing all a safe and enriching 2022 ahead!
