Nurturing Passionate Learners, Cultivating Caring Leaders 

It is with great pleasure and enthusiasm that I extend a warm welcome to all members of the North View family—students, parents, educators, and community partners. As we embark on another exciting academic year, it is essential to reflect on the core values and vision that define us as a school community.

At North View Primary School, our vision is to nurture "Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders," a commitment that resonates deeply within our school community. As we collectively strive towards this vision, we are firmly anchored in our core values of Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, and Graciousness (R³InG). These values serve as our guiding principles, shaping the character of our students and preparing them not only for the challenges of today but also for the opportunities and responsibilities that lie ahead in the future.

Our commitment to the principle of "Student First, Staff is Key" underscores our dedication to holistic student development. We believe in fostering an environment where our students can thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. We also believe that an enabling learning environment is built on a foundation of quality teaching, and as such, we prioritize the cultivation of a robust teaching force. Our educators play a pivotal role in shaping the minds and character of our students, and we are devoted to providing them with the support and autonomy they need to excel in their roles.

One of the cornerstones of our academic offerings is our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), **Sustainable Living Starts with Me**, aims to equip Northviewans with the knowledge and skills needed to address sustainability issues. Through this program, students will engage in critical thinking and leverage innovation skills, employing Design Thinking to provide solutions for sustainable living.

Complementing the ALP is our Learning for Life Programme (LLP), **Confidence through Performing Arts**. This initiative exposes Northviewans to various genres of dance and musical instruments, fostering confidence and creativity through the performing arts.

North View Primary School is not merely an institution; it is a vibrant community woven together by dedicated educators, supportive parents, and collaborative community partners. Together, we emphasize the significance of a positive school culture—one that nurtures growth, fosters learning, and celebrates achievements.

As we embark on another academic year, let us continue to work hand in hand, ensuring that North View Primary School remains a place where passion for learning is ignited, caring leaders are cultivated, and a bright future is crafted.

Thank you for being part of the North View family.

Warm regards,

Mrs Grace Chua
