**Passionate Learners and Caring Leaders 
in North View Primary & MK@North View**

Welcome to North View Primary School! 
Our school vision is **“Passionate Learners, Caring Leaders”** and as a school community we are firmly anchored in our core values of **R**esilience, **R**espect, **R**esponsibility, **I**ntegrity and **G**raciousness **(R³InG)**, as we prepare Northviewians not just for today but for the future.  

We enter 2023 with much gratitude. I am exceedingly proud of the strength and fortitude our North View Primary community demonstrated these past three years as they cared for each other and ensured that learning continued unabated. 

School life at NVPS is not just returning to pre-COVID vibrancy but has been transformed for the better. Our school facilities have been enhanced significantly with the completion of PERI upgrading. We now have a new 5-storey building with an indoor sports hall, a synthetic school field, outdoor learning centres, a better equipped Media Resource Library (MRL), etc., to support holistic education. We are also going to have our own MakerSpace to support sustainability education and renovation is underway.

But a school is not just about its “hardware”.  What is more important is its “heartware”.  This is why NVPS will continue to actively build and promote a **Positive School Culture**. In 2022, we launched a **Gratitude Project** among the Primary 5 Northviewans. When we read the heartwarming notes of appreciation written by our students, we knew the pilot was successful. The **Gratitude Project** will be launched school-wide this year. Through sharing of school values-based stories, we want to inspire our students and staff to show care and respect using positive and affirmative language, to people in their lives.  

NVPS is also equally focused on enhancing “headware”, especially that which is future-oriented. At the end of 2022, our school obtained approval for our **Applied Learning Programme (ALP), “Sustainable Living Starts with Me”**. Through this ALP, Northviewans will have the opportunity to gain awareness about sustainability issues, develop critical thinking and leverage on innovation skills through Design Thinking to provide solutions for sustainable patterns of living. This ALP is a complement to our **Learning for Life Programme (LLP), “Confidence through Performing Arts”**, which provides Northviewians with exposure to different genres of dances and musical instruments. These experiences build confidence in communication and expression through experimentation with the different arts forms. These two signature programmes integrated into the school curriculum will greatly enrich Northviewans’ learning experiences and provide platforms to spark passion in learning. 

There is much in the future that is challenging but it is precisely in this VUCA context that we need to shine a stronger spotlight on our humanness. At NVPS, we are acutely aware that while we cannot predict the future of life and work for our Northviewians, we can do our best to develop the right “heartware” and “headware” to prepare them for that world. 

NVPS enters 2023 with hope because together with our community of stakeholders, I am confident that we will foster a vibrant and caring learning environment to empower all Northviewans to aspire, grow and excel.
