North View Primary School (NVPS) was established in 1995 with our founding Principal Mr Lawrence Chong. Its official opening was held on 2 August 1997 and graced by Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, then Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC.

  

Ms Fuziah Taha was our second Principal of NVPS from 2000 to 2005. During her term, the school was upgraded on-site under the MOE Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Exiting Schools (PRIME) Programme and was completed in 2002.

  

Mr Ng Yeow Ling joined the school as our third Principal of NVPS from 2006 to 2012. To create a more conducive and vibrant school environment for teaching and learning, he added new facilities such as the Character Hub, the Eco-garden and the Guzheng studio.

  

Our fourth Principal Mdm Tan U-Tong Evelyn has been leading us from 2013 – Dec 2017. Under her tenure, she created learning spaces outside of the classroom in line with our emphasis on metacognitive development such as a Metacognitive Learning Space and an Outdoor Chess set.

  

Mrs Soh Mei Foong was our fifth Principal from 2017 to 2023. Under her leadership, NVPS focused on the school’s vision and values to develop self-directedly learners who are confident and morally upright and who are active contributors, both to the school and to the larger community. The school successfully completed its PERI upgrading  and welcomed its first cohort of MOE Kindergarten students in 2021.  In 2022, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) : Sustainable Living Starts with Me.  



In Dec 2023, we welcomed Mrs Grace Chua as our sixth Principal. North View Primary School will continue our invested efforts in developing every child to their fullest potential.
