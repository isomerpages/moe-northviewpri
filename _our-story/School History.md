North View Primary School (NVPS) was established in 1995 with our founding Principal Mr Lawrence Chong. Its official opening was held on 2 August 1997 and graced by Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, then Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC.

  

Ms Fuziah Taha was our second Principal of NVPS from 2000 to 2005. During her term, the school was upgraded on-site under the MOE Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Exiting Schools (PRIME) Programme and was completed in 2002.

  

Mr Ng Yeow Ling joined the school as our third Principal of NVPS from 2006 to 2012. To create a more conducive and vibrant school environment for teaching and learning, he added new facilities such as the Character Hub, the Eco-garden and the Guzheng studio.

  

Our fourth Principal Mdm Tan U-Tong Evelyn has been leading us from 2013 â€“ Dec 2017. Under her tenure, she created learning spaces outside of the classroom in line with our emphasis on metacognitive development such as a Metacognitive Learning Space and an Outdoor Chess set.

  

In Dec 2017, we welcomed Mrs Soh Mei Foong as our fifth Principal. Under her leadership, NVPS will continue to develop all our children to their fullest potential.
