#### **Department Overview**


The Student Leadership Committee aims to develop every student to be a Caring Leader. The committee believes that leadership can be nurtured and all students have the potential to be developed as leaders. Every student will be equipped with the basic leadership skills to lead oneself first before leading others.

#### **Curriculum and pedagogy / Approach**


Our school’s student leadership development approach is "Lead Self and Lead Others". All students will undergo a whole-school leadership programme. This programme leverages on Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) to educate and nurture our students to develop the following Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) competencies:

**Level 3:**&nbsp;Prefects are students who have displayed greater leadership potential among their peers. They are provided with various platforms to hone their leadership skills through serving the school and community.

  

**Level 4:**&nbsp;Teachers, students and school leaders play a part in deciding the Executive Committee (EXCO) Prefects. EXCO Prefects are students who have exhibited exemplary character and leadership qualities among the prefects. They represent the voice of the student population and are involved in planning meaningful project and event.
