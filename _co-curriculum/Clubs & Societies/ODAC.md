ODAC aims to provide opportunities for students to realise and develop their self-identity and importance in the community. It facilitates a studentâ€™s learning through experiential learning and guided discovery.

  
Through ODAC, students would be able to:

*   Adapt to any changes and overcome challenges.
*   Grow and build their self-identity, with a heart for the environment and others.
*   Explore new experiences, environments and boundaries.
