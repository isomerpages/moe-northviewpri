In NVPS Environmental Science Club, we have a group of enthusiastic teachers and students who love Science! We conduct hands-on experiments beyond the curriculum where we verify different Science theories. We also engage in upcycling projects to give new lease of life to used products and materials that are often thrown away. We create upcycled items and share them with the rest of our classmates! The journey of exploration in the world of Science begins in our Environmental Science Club!
