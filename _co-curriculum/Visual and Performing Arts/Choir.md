<p>North View Choir aims to promote choral singing and provide a platform
to showcase the beautiful voices and choral talents of all choir members.
We believe that it is of utmost importance to engage our members in meaningful
experiences through exposure to a wide repertoire of choral pieces and
participation in performance opportunities. Choir members will be able
to discover the art of working cohesively as a team, develop resilience
and a sense of individual responsibility, as well as gain confidence in
performing onstage.</p>
