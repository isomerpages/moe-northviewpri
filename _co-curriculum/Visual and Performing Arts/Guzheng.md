The Guzheng, which is a Chinese plucked zither, is also described as ‘The King of Instruments’ for its beautiful timbre and strong expressive power. NVPS Guzheng CCA aims to develop players’ artistic sentiment in a nurturing environment. Players have ample opportunities to perform through school and community platforms. We have achieved six consecutive Gold Awards/Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) from 2004 to 2014, Accomplishment Award in 2016 and Distinction Award in 2018. Our Guzheng players pride themselves as a team that creates symphonious music while fostering self-discipline, friendship, and passion.
