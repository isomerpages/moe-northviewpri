Creative Hands provides a platform for our members to unleash their creativity and build confidence in them to be versatile artists. We engage our members with unique projects and challenge them to explore different art mediums such as different forms of painting, printmaking, sculpture and mixed media.

Creative Hands develops our members in the following ways:

*   Build character, team spirit and responsibility
*   Inculcate a sense of belonging to the CCA and to the school
*   Provide opportunities for leadership experience and develop leadership potential
*   Nurture art knowledge, skills and attitudes

Artist Statement:**

Several of us have played ‘Minecraft’. We would like to create a pixelated world where we imagine ourselves living in it. We would also like to create an art piece that shows our appreciation of how technology has improved or affected our lives. We are proud of our collaborative artwork!
