<p>NVPS Malay Dance serves as a platform for students to learn and appreciate
the Malay culture and traditions through the different types of Malay traditional
dances. The 5 basic dance genres which includes Inang, Zapin, Joget, Asli
and Masri, have been known to portray rhythm and grace of the dancers.
Students will be able to explore the dynamics and styles of the various
genres. On top of that, they will also be equipped with knowledge on the
Malay music beats and rhythms. Collaborative learning during practices
allows students to express themselves while honing their leadership skills.</p>
<p>Malay Dance was newly reformed in 2019. On August 1st, 2019, the team
participated in an external performance, SchoolARTS@SKH Campus. It was
the first ever performance for the team where they performed for the nurses
to celebrate this amazing heroes. Covid 19 hit in 2020 and the team could
not take part in Singapore Youth Festival. However, the group remained
active and performed through pre-recorded videos for schools shows like
Hari Raya Performances in 2020 and 2021 and Prize Giving Ceremony in 2021.</p>
