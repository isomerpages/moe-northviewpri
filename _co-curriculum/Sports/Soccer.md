<p>In North View Primary School, we believe in developing our pupils to their
fullest potential. In Football CCA, we aim to enrich and empower individuals
in the beautiful game of football to foster team work, discipline and determination.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Highlights</strong></h4>
<p>North View Football CCA acknowledges the importance to provide the competitive
exposure to our players and hence we take part in competitions all year
round, beyond the annual Singapore Primary School Zonal Football Competition,
at every given opportunity</p>

Academys in Singapore to participate in football day camps conducted by
overseas coaches.</p>
