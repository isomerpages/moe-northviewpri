In NVPS Floorball CCA, we hope to instill qualities such as teamwork, sportsmanship, and determination to achieve oneâ€™s fullest potential. Through Floorball, we also aim to develop a strong sense of camaraderie, friendship, and humility. Teamwork, dedication, friendship and respect are the guiding values that NVPS Floorball players adhere to. Selected floorball players will be able to represent the school in the Junior/Senior National School Games yearly. Through the competition, we hope our NVPS floorball players will be able to gain exposure and most importantly, self-confidence and sportsmanship.
