Our whole school gathered in the hall on 20th January to celebrate Chinese New Year. Before the concert, students learnt about the origins of the Zodiac and the story of "Nian".Â During the concert, students learnt about Chinese customary practices during the 15 days of Chinese New Year. During the concert, there was a mini quiz to test students' knowledge about Chinese New Year. Prefects and class leaders presented the mandarin oranges to the teachers. The concert ended with an amazing display of the Lion Dance!
