This annual award by the Singapore Hokkein Huay Kuan is to affirm exceptional teachers who have made a positive impact in nurturing their students from the heart.  The naming of the award signifies a leap of faith for a teacher to believe that students have the potential to excel beyond their capabilities.  Mdm Png Suat Kheng has been presented a Certificate of Commendation as a recognition of her contribution towards education.
