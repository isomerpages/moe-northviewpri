On the morning of 5th October, North View Primary School transformed into a fun and exciting place for all Northviewans.

The PAM department planned and worked together as a team, building on the strong support from the school, and delivered a memorable Childrenâ€™s Day experience for all.

Our Northviewans had a fun time while also learning about healthy lifestyles and bonding as One.
