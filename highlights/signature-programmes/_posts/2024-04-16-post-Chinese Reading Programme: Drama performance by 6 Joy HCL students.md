<p>The Chinese Language Department Reading Committee recently organized a
drama performance entitled "The Brilliant Three Kingdoms - Borrowing Arrows
with Straw Boats" (《精彩三国》之《草船借箭》). The actors and actresses were from the
6 JOY HCL Class. This performance vividly brought the textbook's content
to life, offering all P6 students a visually enriching experience. The
CL Reading Committee aims to ignite students' love for Chinese culture
through such activities.</p>
